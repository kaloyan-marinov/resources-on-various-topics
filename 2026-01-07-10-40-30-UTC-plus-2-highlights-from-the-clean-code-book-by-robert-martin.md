   ## footnote on `G21: Understand the Algorithm`

   There is a difference between
   knowing how the code works
   and
   knowing whether the algorithm will do the job required of it.
   Being unsure that an algorithm is appropriate often a fact of life.
   Being unsure what your code does is just laziness.
