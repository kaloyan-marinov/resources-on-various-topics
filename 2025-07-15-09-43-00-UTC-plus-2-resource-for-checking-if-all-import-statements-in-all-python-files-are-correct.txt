    if your repository's Python files live in a sub-folder `./src/`,
    then it is possible to check
    whether the import statements within each file are correct

    to perform that check, 
    run the following command:
    ```
    find src/ -name '*.py' \
        | sed 's^src/\(.*\)\.py^\1^' \
        | sed 's^/^.^g' \
        | xargs -I filename poetry run python -c "import filename"
    ```
