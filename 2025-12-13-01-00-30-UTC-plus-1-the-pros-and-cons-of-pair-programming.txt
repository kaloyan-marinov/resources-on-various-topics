The Pros & Cons Of Pair Programming (With Examples)

    More code is rarely a good idea.

    For the best code, what we'd really like is to type less but achieve more.

    The simpler our code for a set of behaviors, the better it is.

    ...

    so,
    trying to find simple solutions to problems
    is much more important than typing fast
    and
    much more efficient than maximizing the rate at which we can create crap code




    in this example,
    we're pairing remotely
    (
    but, to be honest,
    with effective modern tools like Tuple,
    there is very little difference in our experience of pairing
    than if we were sitting together;

    Tuple makes remote screen and keyboard sharing seamless

    I should remind you though that
    Tuple are one of our Channel sponsors and we do thank them for it
