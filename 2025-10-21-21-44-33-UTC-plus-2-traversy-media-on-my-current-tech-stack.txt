    [Symptek] is a symptom tracker to track health issues and symptoms,
    with all kinds of analytics ...

    I started out vibe coding

    this months ago and it didn't work out.

    I got all kinds of errors that were

    being suppressed and then when I would

    try to fix them, more things broke and

    it just ended up in just a mess. And it

    taught me a lesson. So, I'm glad it

    happened. It taught me that you can't

    just stay within the prompt and build a

    large application. It just it isn't

    going to work out. You need to get in

    there and manually run and write code

    and test.
