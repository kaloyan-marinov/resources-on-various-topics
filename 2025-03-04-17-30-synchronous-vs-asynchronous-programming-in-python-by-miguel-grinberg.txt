notes:

    To benefit from the async style,
    an application needs to have tasks that
    are often blocked by I/O
    and
    don't take too much CPU work.

    Web applications are normally a good fit,
    in particular if they need to handle large amounts of client requests.

        [TBD]



    The 2 most important takeaways [to] remember are:

        An async application will only do better than a sync application under high load.

        Thanks to greenlets,
        it is possible to benefit from async
        even if you write normal code & use traditional frameworks such as Flask or Django.
