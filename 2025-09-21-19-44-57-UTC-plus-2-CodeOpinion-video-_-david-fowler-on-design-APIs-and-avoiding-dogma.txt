    David Fowler:
    
        can you describe Aspire to me ... in one paragraph?



    Derek Comartin:

        not even a paragraph. I almost have one word...
        I'm going to say ... it's composition.



    David Fowler:
    
        Yeah! Yes!
        ...
        That's the right word!
        ...

            Q: of what?

            A: of your app - all the pieces


    Derek Comartin:
    
        almost every app is distributed

            you could have a monolith

            it has a database

            it has a cache

    David Fowler:

        Exactly!
        You got it!
