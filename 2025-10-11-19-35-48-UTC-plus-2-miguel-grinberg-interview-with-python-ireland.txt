    many times I compare
    what I write
    with what GitHub Copilot suggests.
    ...
    It's not great.
    ...
    For any kind of professional work, it's not great.



    ...
    vibe coding [is] great ... if you come from the bottom...
    
    If
    you don't know something
    and
    you're going to do something ... that doesn't have to be robust[,]
    the AI will be great...
    You're likely to get some results that you would not be able to achieve yourself
    unless you spend a lot of time learning.



    Coming from the other side,
    [i.e.] when you're experienced,
    I don't really see a lot of value
    
        because ... think about this:
        It was trained on all the code on GitHub -
        without [regard for whether that was] good code [or] bad code...
        So, the chances that
        you're going to get really good code [suggestions] that will be equal to what you will write
        are ... really slim.

    ...
    Every time I look at a suggestion that GitHub Copilot offers,
    I feel that I can do better.
    
    
    
    ...
    Vibe coders can
    write «throwaway code» and
    get results and
    then they forget about it...
    [AI-assisted coding] seems reasonable for that.



    But in my case,
    [I work on code ...]
    that I'm going to have to maintain.
    [It's not «throwaway code».]
    
    At least ... today's models [are] not able to provide ... good support for a person like me.



    ... many ... people say that
    a coding AI is like you get an intern that is very happy ... to help you...
    But this is an intern that has short-term memory loss...
    because every time you open the chat to talk to this AI,
    it doesn't remember anything, it doesn't learn anything...

    I really want a human intern that I can train ... [and] gets better[.] ...
    
    Give me an AI that learns, maybe I'll look at it.



        This is something interesting[.]
        This is not a thought that came from me
        but I read somewhere and I think [that]
        what we are going to need going forward is
        we're going to need to be very good at code reviewing
        which is something that we are not.
        
        Many people they're not used to [reviewing] code in the same way that

            now when we look at a picture on Twitter ...
            if it's too good to be true...
            we [- or at least, a significant number of us - have been] programmed to distrust [it].

            ...
            so the same thing is going to have to happen with code.

        You cannot
        take code that comes from an unknown source
        and
        assume, because it works, that it's good and that you will be able to maintain...
        You really have to do a good review.

    ...
    People often do say that
    it's harder to read code than to write code...
    It takes a lot of skill ...
    It's something that ... people ... need to be aware of, going forward.



    ...
    Even ... if you end up using AI as a helper[,]
    you're going to have to - at least if you get paid to do the work ...
    If you're doing this for work - professionally, ...
    
        you're going to have to learn and understand

        [to the point where]
        you will need to be able to write what you're asking the AI to write for you ...



    maybe  the AI with time eventually the AI will be able  

    to do it faster than you That's possible right so  it may be good I may end up at some point decide  

    I may decide that it works for me as well in that  capacity

        but it definitely needs to be something  

        that I intended to write in the first place 
        if I'm  going to be on the hook to maintain that code and  

        be responsible for it
