    uh GitHub Copilot suggests Yeah it's not great  you know for any kind of professional work it's  

    not great Okay I so

    now you know we're all seeing  people who do vibe coding that's great right if  

    you come from the bottom right and if you don't  know something and you're going to do something  

    you know that doesn't have to be robust you  know the AI will be great right you're likely  

    to get some results that you would not be able  to achieve yourself unless you spend a lot of   time learning right great for that



    coming from  the other side right when you're experienced I  

    don't really see a lot of value because the code  that


        So think about this It was trained on all  

        the code on GitHub right Right without regards  of being good code bad code It's just code right  

        so the chances that you're going to get really  good code that will be equal to what you will  

        write are you know really slim



    And I'm every time  I look at a suggestion that GitHub Copilot offers  

    I feel that I can do better And given that when  I'm working on code this is code that I'm going  

    to have to maintain It's not throwaway code right



    yeah So that the vibe coders can write throwaway  

    code and get results and then they forget about it  and that seems reasonable for that



    But in my case  

    this is code that I'm going to have to maintain So  yes I don't really see at least today's you know  

    today's models they're not able to provide you  know good support for a person like me



    ... this is something that I read many  times People say that a coding AI is like you get  

    an intern that is very happy to you know to help  you

        That's great But this is an intern that has  

        short-term memory loss right because every time  you open the chat to talk to this AI it doesn't  

        remember anything It doesn't learn anything right



        I really want a human intern that I can train Yeah  

        I get better It gets better right that give me  that Give me an AI that learns Maybe I look at it



    But but these you know this crop of stupid AIs  that don't have memory Yeah I I don't know I mean  

    there's some use for them right I don't want to  you to be completely negative doesn't provide good  

    use to me






    That's interesting I mean yeah I mean  I've seen some of the results of vibe coding over  

    the last couple years or you know some colleagues  of mine you know certainly one colleague of mine  

    has seen some disasters and that has been brought  in

        Oh they're awful Yeah I mean so and you know  

        this is something interesting this this is not  something this is not a thought that came from me  

        but I read somewhere and I think what we are going  to need going forward is we're going to need to be  

        very good at code reviewing which is something  that we are not many people they're not used to  

        review code in the same way that

            now when we look  at a picture on Twitter or you know whatever you  

            know if it's too good to be true we say yeah this  you know we were programmed to distrust pictures  

            right because of the AI right so the same thing  is going to have to happen with code

        You cannot  

        take code that comes from an unknown source and  assume because it works that it's good and that  

        you will be able to maintain it right you really  have to do a good review

    That's a very good point  

    I mean I people often do say that

        it's harder to  read code than to write code sometimes

        right ... it takes  a lot of skill ...

        It's something that that people you know need to  be aware of going forward



    ...
    Maybe they'll find their way to the Flask  Mega-Tutorial the resources and you know start to  

    go a bit deeper and and learn the craft themselves ...

        which you are going to need if you  

        need to review code even if if you end up using  AI as a helper you're going to have to make sure  

        that the code that the AI is giving you at least  if you get paid to do the work right Yeah Right  



        if you're doing this for work professionally I  don't see how you can trust blindly trust AI right  

        you're going to have to learn and understand



        So  basically you will need to be able to write what  

        you're asking the AI to write for you ...



    maybe  the AI with time eventually the AI will be able  

    to do it faster than you That's possible right so  it may be good I may end up at some point decide  

    I may decide that it works for me as well in that  capacity

        but it definitely needs to be something  

        that I intended to write in the first place 
        if I'm  going to be on the hook to maintain that code and  

        be responsible for it
