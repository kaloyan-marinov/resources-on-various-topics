I've found something BETTER than pull requests...

sometimes people say that I'm dogmatic

and while I can recognize that I'm certainly opinionated about things,
I don't think that I am dogmatic

let me explain

    I don't believe in or follow any dogma

        «dogma» is defined as a principle or set of principles
        laid down by an authority as incontrovertibly true

    I'm argumentative - I hope in a respectful and nice way - but I _am_ argumentative

    I don't take anyone's opinion as correct only because of who they are - including my own

    so I'm not dogmatic



    I like to form my opinions based fundamentally on two things:

        data and evidence

        and

        reasoning based on my understanding
        (
        I like
        to have a mental model for why and how things work the way that they do
        and
        to see if that fits into with the facts as far as I can understand them and perceive them
        )
